This research presents a comprehensive machine learning framework designed for the early-stage detection of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD).
ASD diagnosis is challenging due to its heterogeneous nature and the need for timely intervention. Leveraging the power of machine learning,
our framework integrates label encoding, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE),
and Logistic Regression (LR) algorithms to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of ASD detection

This research aims to create an effective prediction model using different types of ML methods to detect autism in people of different ages
. First of all, the datasets are collected, and then the preprocessing is accomplished the missing values imputation, Label encoding, and
oversampling and Create an instance of RFE with the classifier and the desired number of features to select Logistic Regression classification of modeling, 
performance evaluation, and the results with improved accuracy.
